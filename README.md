### Repository Description:

**Store Sales Time Series Forecasting**  
This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle competition [Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/overview). The objective of this project is to predict unit sales for various items across multiple stores using time-series forecasting techniques.  

### Contents:
- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Scripts to clean and prepare the data for analysis.  
- **Model Development**: Code for building and training machine learning models.  
- **Evaluation**: Analysis of model performance using Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE).  
- **Submission**: Final predictions in the required CSV format for leaderboard ranking.  
- **Documentation**: A README file describing the workflow, approach, and results.

This project demonstrates my skills in time-series analysis, data preprocessing, and model optimization for accurate sales forecasting.
